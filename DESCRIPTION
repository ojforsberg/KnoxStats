Description: This package provides a collection of support functions specifically designed for students in introductory statistics and linear models courses. It streamlines common tasks — such as performing hypothesis testing, visualizing data distributions, and interpreting regression outputs — so you can focus on mastering core statistical concepts rather than wrestling with complex R code.
