\title{Calculate the Mode of a Dataset}
\usage{
modal(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A vector (numeric, character, or factor) for which to find the mode.}
}
\value{
If there is a single mode, returns that value as a character string.
If there are multiple modes, returns a character vector of all modes.
If there is no mode (all values appear exactly once), returns
"There is no mode." as a character string.
}
\description{
Finds the mode(s) of a dataset, which is the value(s) that appear most
frequently. Unlike the mean and median, a dataset can have zero, one, or
multiple modes.
}
\details{
The mode is a measure of central tendency that identifies the most
frequently occurring value(s) in a dataset. This function can handle:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Unimodal datasets}: One value appears most frequently
\item \strong{Bimodal/multimodal datasets}: Multiple values tie for most frequent
\item \strong{No mode}: All values appear exactly once (equifrequent)
}

The function first creates a frequency table of the data, identifies
which value(s) have the maximum frequency, and returns them. If all
values have the same frequency (including the case where each value
appears only once), it returns a message indicating there is no mode.
}
\examples{
# Single mode (unimodal)
scores <- c(85, 90, 85, 88, 92, 85, 90)
modal(scores)

# Two modes (bimodal)
colors <- c("red", "blue", "red", "blue", "green")
modal(colors)

# No mode (all unique)
unique_values <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
modal(unique_values)

# All values appear the same number of times (no mode)
equal_freq <- c("A", "B", "A", "B")
modal(equal_freq)

# Mode with factors
grade_factor <- factor(c("A", "B", "A", "C", "B", "A"))
modal(grade_factor)
