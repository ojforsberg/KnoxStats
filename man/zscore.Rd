\title{Calculate Z-Scores}
\usage{
zscore(x, na.rm = TRUE, names = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector for which to calculate z-scores.}

\item{na.rm}{Logical. Should missing values be removed? Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{names}{Optional character vector of names to assign to the output.
If provided, this vector should have the same length as \code{x}.
Default is \code{NA} (no names).}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of z-scores with the same length as \code{x}.
If \code{names} is provided, the output will have just those names.
}
\description{
Computes standardized z-scores for a numeric vector. Z-scores indicate how many
standard deviations each value is from the mean, allowing comparison of data
from different distributions or data sets.
}
\details{
Z-scores (also called standard scores) transform data to have a mean of 0
and a standard deviation of 1. This standardization process allows you to:
\itemize{
\item Compare values from different data sets
\item Identify outliers (typically values with |z-score| > 3)
\item Understand how unusual a particular observation is
\item Prepare data for certain statistical analyses
}

The formula used is:
\deqn{z = \frac{x - \bar{x}}{s}}
where \eqn{\bar{x}} is the sample mean and \eqn{s} is the sample standard deviation.
}
\section{Warning}{

When all values in \code{x} are identical, the standard deviation will be 0,
resulting in division by zero. The function will return \code{NaN} for all values
in this case with a warning message.
}

\examples{
# Basic example with exam scores
exam_scores <- c(85, 92, 78, 96, 82, 88, 75, 98, 81, 90)
zscore(exam_scores)

# With names for each score
student_names <- paste0("Student_", LETTERS[1:10])
zscore(exam_scores, names = student_names)

# Handling missing values
scores_with_na <- c(85, 92, NA, 96, 82, 88, NA, 98, 81, 90)
zscore(scores_with_na)
zscore(scores_with_na, na.rm = FALSE)

# Identifying outliers
data <- c(12, 15, 14, 13, 15, 100, 12, 14, 13)  # 100 is an outlier
z_scores <- zscore(data)
which(abs(z_scores) > 3)  # Identify position of outlier

# Comparing two different datasets
math_scores <- c(85, 92, 78, 96, 82)
english_scores <- c(88, 85, 92, 79, 84)

# Convert both to z-scores for comparison
math_z <- zscore(math_scores)
english_z <- zscore(english_scores)

# Now we can compare performance across subjects
cbind(math_scores, math_z, english_scores, english_z)
