\usage{
concordanceRatio(x, y = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A vector or a matrix of numbers.}

\item{y}{A vector of numbers. This is required if x is a vector.}
}
\value{
List of the number of concordant and discordant points and the concordance ratio.
}
\description{
\code{concordanceRatio} calculates the number of concordant and discordant points in bivariate data
}
\details{
This function calculates the concordance ratio for bivariate data, which measures
the proportion of concordant pairs relative to all comparable pairs.

A pair of points (i, j) is considered \strong{concordant} if:
\itemize{
\item \code{x[i] > x[j]} and \code{y[i] > y[j]}, or
\item \code{x[i] < x[j]} and \code{y[i] < y[j]}
}

A pair is \strong{discordant} if:
\itemize{
\item \code{x[i] > x[j]} and \code{y[i] < y[j]}, or
\item \code{x[i] < x[j]} and \code{y[i] > y[j]}
}

Pairs where \code{x[i] == x[j]} or \code{y[i] == y[j]} are neither concordant
nor discordant and are excluded from the calculation.

The \strong{concordance ratio} is calculated as:
\deqn{\text{ratio} = \frac{\text{concordant}}{\text{concordant} + \text{discordant}}}

This ratio ranges from 0 (perfect discordance) to 1 (perfect concordance),
with 0.500 indicating no association.

When \code{x} is a matrix, it should have two columns where the first column
is treated as \code{x} and the second as \code{y}, and the \code{y} parameter is ignored.
