\title{Odds Ratio Test for 2×2 Contingency Tables}
\usage{
oddsRatio(
  t,
  alternative = c("two.sided", "less", "greater"),
  conf.level = 0.95,
  mu = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{t}{A 2×2 matrix or table containing frequency counts. Rows typically
represent exposure groups (e.g., treatment vs. control), and columns
represent outcomes (e.g., success vs. failure).}

\item{alternative}{A character string specifying the alternative hypothesis:
\code{"two.sided"} (default), \code{"less"}, or \code{"greater"}.
This determines whether the test looks for any difference (\code{"two.sided"}),
a smaller odds ratio (\code{"less"}), or a larger odds ratio (\code{"greater"}).}

\item{conf.level}{The confidence level for the confidence interval (default = 0.95).
Must be between 0 and 1.}

\item{mu}{The hypothesized value of the odds ratio under the null hypothesis
(default = 1, indicating no association). Must be positive.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{"htest"} containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{statistic}: The test statistic (Z-score)
\item \code{parameter}: NULL (not used in this test)
\item \code{p.value}: The p-value for the test
\item \code{conf.int}: Confidence interval for the odds ratio
\item \code{estimate}: The estimated odds ratio
\item \code{null.value}: The hypothesized odds ratio
\item \code{alternative}: The alternative hypothesis
\item \code{method}: The name of the test
\item \code{data.name}: The name of the data
}
}
\description{
Performs a hypothesis test for the odds ratio in a 2×2 contingency table.
This test determines whether there is a significant association between
two categorical variables by comparing the odds of an event occurring
in two different groups.
}
\details{
The odds ratio measures the strength of association between two binary variables.
It compares the odds of an event occurring in one group to the odds of it
occurring in another group.

\deqn{OR = \frac{a \times d}{b \times c}}
where the 2×2 table has the structure:
\tabular{cccc}{
\tab Success \tab Failure \tab Total\cr
Group 1  \tab a       \tab b       \tab a+b\cr
Group 2  \tab c       \tab d       \tab c+d
}

The test uses the log odds ratio, which is approximately normally distributed
for large samples. The standard error is calculated using:
\deqn{SE(\log(OR)) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} + \frac{1}{d}}}

A p-value < 0.05 typically indicates a statistically significant association
between the variables.

\examples{
# Example 1: Vaccine efficacy study
# A study comparing infection rates between vaccinated and unvaccinated groups
vaccine_data <- matrix(c(20, 80, 100, 400), nrow = 2, 
                      dimnames = list(Treatment = c("Vaccine", "Placebo"),
                                      Outcome = c("Infected", "Not Infected")))
vaccine_data

# Two-sided test (default)
oddsRatio(vaccine_data)

# Test with 90\% confidence interval
oddsRatio(vaccine_data, conf.level = 0.90)

# One-sided test: Is the odds ratio less than 1?
oddsRatio(vaccine_data, alternative = "less")

# Example 2: Smoking and lung cancer (classic example)
cancer_data <- matrix(c(688, 650, 21, 59), nrow = 2,
                     dimnames = list(Smoking = c("Yes", "No"),
                                     Cancer = c("Yes", "No")))
cancer_data

oddsRatio(cancer_data)

# Example 3: Test a specific null hypothesis
# Is the odds ratio different from 2?
oddsRatio(vaccine_data, mu = 2)
