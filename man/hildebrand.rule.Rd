\title{The Hildebrand Rule}
\usage{
hildebrand.rule(x, ...)

\method{hildebrand.rule}{default}(x, y = NA, rec = 0, na.rm = TRUE)

\method{hildebrand.rule}{formula}(formula, na.rm = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector}

\item{...}{Additional parameters passed to the instances of this function}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the group name, the Hildebrand ratio, and whether or not (and in which direction) the data are skewed.

#' @details
The Hildebrand Rule is a simple test for assessing data skewness by comparing the mean and median.
This implementation calculates the Hildebrand ratio as:

\deqn{H = \frac{\bar{x} - M}{s}}{H = (mean(x) - median(x)) / sd(x)}

Where \eqn{\bar{x}} is the sample mean, \eqn{M} is the median, and \eqn{s} is the sample standard deviation.

The function interprets the ratio as follows:
\itemize{
\item \code{H > 0.2}: Data are "sufficiently" right-skewed (positively skewed)
\item \code{H < -0.2}: Data are "sufficiently" left-skewed (negatively skewed)
\item Otherwise: Data are not sufficiently skewed by this rule
}

The threshold of \eqn{\pm 0.2} is based on Hildebrand's original suggestion. Note that this is a
rule-of-thumb rather than a formal statistical test. The function handles missing values by default
via \code{na.rm = TRUE} in internal calculations.

\description{
Calculates the Hildebrand ratio and uses it to determine if the data are "sufficiently" skewed and in which direction.

\examples{
# Right-skewed data
x_right <- rexp(100, rate = 1)
hildebrand.rule(x_right)

# Left-skewed data  
x_left <- -rexp(100, rate = 1)
hildebrand.rule(x_left)

# Symmetric data
x_sym <- rnorm(100, mean = 10, sd = 2)
hildebrand.rule(x_sym)
