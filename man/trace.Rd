\usage{
trace(X)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A square numeric matrix (or a data frame that can be coerced to a matrix).}
}
\value{
A single numeric value representing the sum of the diagonal elements.
}
\description{
Calculates the trace of a square matrix. The trace is the sum of the
elements on the main diagonal of a square matrix.
}
\details{
The trace of a square matrix is a fundamental concept in linear algebra
with important applications in statistics. In statistics, the trace appears in:
\itemize{
\item{Principal Component Analysis (PCA): The sum of eigenvalues equals the trace}
\item{Multivariate statistics: Used in various test statistics and calculations}
\item{Matrix derivatives: Important in optimization problems}
}

The trace has several useful mathematical properties:
\enumerate{
\item{For square matrices A and B of the same size: \code{tr(A + B) = tr(A) + tr(B)}}
\item{For a scalar c: \code{tr(cA) = c * tr(A)}}
\item{The trace is invariant under cyclic permutations: \code{tr(AB) = tr(BA)}}
}

This function performs error checking to ensure the input is a square matrix
before calculating the trace.

\examples{
# Example 1: Basic 2x2 matrix
A <- matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4), nrow = 2, ncol = 2)
trace(A)  # Returns 1 + 4 = 5

# Example 2: 3x3 identity matrix
I3 <- diag(3)
trace(I3)  # Returns 3 (sum of diagonal ones)

# Example 3: Demonstrating the cyclic property
B <- matrix(c(2, 0, 1, 1), nrow = 2)
C <- matrix(c(1, 3, 2, 4), nrow = 2)

# These should be equal due to cyclic property:
trace(A \%*\% B)  
trace(B \%*\% A)  # Should be the same as above

# Example 4: Error handling for non-square matrix
\dontrun{
D <- matrix(1:6, nrow = 2, ncol = 3)
trace(D)  # This will throw an error
}

# Example 5: Using with statistical applications
# Create a covariance matrix
set.seed(123)
data <- matrix(rnorm(30), ncol = 3)
cov_matrix <- cov(data)

# Total variance equals trace of covariance matrix
total_variance <- trace(cov_matrix)
print(paste("Total variance:", round(total_variance, 3)))
