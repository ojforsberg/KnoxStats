\title{VIF-Adjusted Regression Summary}
\usage{
summaryVIFA(mod, showVIF = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{mod}{A linear regression model object created by \code{\link{lm}}.}

\item{showVIF}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, includes VIF column in output.
Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A matrix containing adjusted regression results with columns for:
\itemize{
\item{Estimate: Coefficient estimates (unchanged from original model)}
\item{Std. Error: Standard errors adjusted for multicollinearity}
\item{t value: t-statistics calculated using adjusted standard errors}
\item{Pr(>|t|): p-values calculated using adjusted t-statistics}
\item{VIF: Variance Inflation Factors (optional, if \code{showVIF = TRUE})}
}
}
\description{
Provides regression coefficient estimates adjusted for multicollinearity using
Variance Inflation Factors (VIF). This function calculates standard errors,
t-values, and p-values that account for inflated variance due to correlated
predictor variables.
}
\details{
When predictor variables in a regression model are highly correlated
(multicollinear), the standard errors of their coefficients become inflated,
making it harder to detect statistically significant relationships.

This function addresses this issue by:
\enumerate{
\item Calculating Variance Inflation Factors (VIF) for each predictor
\item Adjusting standard errors by dividing them by the square root of VIF
\item Recalculating t-statistics and p-values using these adjusted standard errors
}

The adjusted results provide a more accurate picture of each predictor's
individual contribution when multicollinearity is present. Note that the
coefficient estimates themselves remain unchanged—only their standard errors
and associated statistics are adjusted.

A common rule of thumb is that VIF values above 5-10 indicate problematic
multicollinearity that may require attention.

\examples{
# Load required package
library(car)

# Example 1: Simple regression with correlated predictors
# Create data with correlated predictors
set.seed(123)
x1 <- rnorm(100)
x2 <- x1 + rnorm(100, sd = 0.5)  # x2 is correlated with x1
y <- 2 + 3*x1 + 4*x2 + rnorm(100)

# Fit linear model
model <- lm(y ~ x1 + x2)

# Get VIF-adjusted summary
summaryVIFA(model)

# Show results with VIF column
summaryVIFA(model, showVIF = TRUE)

# Example 2: Compare with standard summary
# Standard output (may show inflated standard errors)
summary(model)

# VIF-adjusted output
summaryVIFA(model, showVIF = TRUE)

# Example 3: Model with uncorrelated predictors
x3 <- rnorm(100)
x4 <- rnorm(100)
y2 <- 1 + 2*x3 + 3*x4 + rnorm(100)
model2 <- lm(y2 ~ x3 + x4)

# VIF should be close to 1 for uncorrelated predictors
summaryVIFA(model2, showVIF = TRUE)
