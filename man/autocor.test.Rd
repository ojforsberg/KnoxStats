\title{Autocorrelation Test}
\usage{
autocor.test(x, na.rm = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector}

\item{...}{Additional parameters sent to \code{cor.test}}
}
\value{
The function returns the results of a correlation test as a class \code{htest}.
}
\description{
\code{autocor.test} calculates the correlation between one element in the vector and the next.
}
\details{
This function performs an autocorrelation test at lag 1 by calculating the
correlation between each element in the vector and its immediate successor.
Internally, it creates two vectors: one containing all elements except the last,
and another containing all elements except the first. These vectors are then
passed to \code{stats::cor.test()} for hypothesis testing.

The test assesses whether there is significant serial correlation in the data,
which can be important for time series analysis and checking independence
assumptions in statistical models. The null hypothesis is that the true
autocorrelation at lag 1 equals zero (no serial correlation).

Note that this implementation specifically tests lag-1 autocorrelation. For
testing autocorrelation at different lags or multiple lags simultaneously,
consider using \code{stats::acf()} or other time series-specific functions.
