\title{Total Absolute Probability Difference (TAPD)}
\usage{
tapd(x, na.rm = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A vector of categorical data (factor, character, or numeric categories).}

\item{na.rm}{Logical; if TRUE (default), missing values (NA) are removed before
calculation. If FALSE and NAs are present, the function will return an error.}
}
\value{
A single numeric value between 0 and 1, where:
\itemize{
\item \strong{0}: Perfectly uniform distribution (equal counts in all categories)
\item \strong{1}: Maximum concentration (all observations in one category)
\item \strong{Values between 0-1}: Degree of deviation from perfect uniformity
}
}
\description{
Calculates the Total Absolute Probability Difference (TAPD), a measure of
distribution uniformity for categorical data. TAPD quantifies how evenly
observations are distributed across categories, with values ranging from
0 (perfectly uniform distribution) to 1 (all observations in one category).
}
\details{
The Total Absolute Probability Difference (TAPD) measures how evenly
observations are distributed across different categories. It's particularly
useful for assessing:
\itemize{
\item Survey response distributions
\item Market share equality
\item Species diversity in ecology
\item Resource allocation fairness
}

The formula calculates:
\deqn{TAPD = 1 - \frac{\sum |f_i - \bar{f}|}{n}}
where \eqn{f_i} is the frequency in category i, \eqn{\bar{f}} is the average
frequency (n/g), n is total observations, and g is number of categories.

This is a normalized version of the mean absolute deviation from uniformity.

\examples{
# Example 1: Perfectly uniform distribution
# Equal numbers in 4 categories
uniform_data <- rep(c("A", "B", "C", "D"), each = 5)
tapd(uniform_data)  # Returns 0 (perfect uniformity)

# Example 2: Highly concentrated distribution
# All observations in one category
concentrated_data <- rep("A", 20)
tapd(concentrated_data)  # Returns 1 (maximum concentration)

# Example 3: Typical survey responses
survey_responses <- c(
  rep("Strongly Agree", 8),
  rep("Agree", 12),
  rep("Neutral", 5),
  rep("Disagree", 3),
  rep("Strongly Disagree", 2)
)
tapd(survey_responses)  # Returns ~0.467

# Example 4: Handling missing values
data_with_na <- c("A", "B", NA, "A", "C", "B", NA, "A")
tapd(data_with_na)  # Automatically removes NAs
tapd(data_with_na, na.rm = FALSE)  # Will produce error

# Example 5: Compare different distributions
dist1 <- rep(c("Yes", "No"), each = 10)  # Perfectly balanced
dist2 <- c(rep("Yes", 15), rep("No", 5))  # Unbalanced

cat("Balanced distribution TAPD:", tapd(dist1), "\n")
cat("Unbalanced distribution TAPD:", tapd(dist2), "\n")
