\usage{
calculateRuns(r)
}
\arguments{
\item{r}{A vector of numbers}
}
\value{
Scalar of the number of runs in the vector \code{r}
}
\description{
\code{calculateRuns} calculates the number of runs (above or below 0) in an ordered vector
}
\details{
A "run" is defined as a consecutive sequence of values that are all
either strictly positive (greater than 0) or strictly negative (less than 0).
Values exactly equal to 0 are treated as breaking runs, meaning they reset
the run count. The function calculates the total number of these runs in the
input vector, counting from the beginning to the end of the sequence.

This implementation follows the standard runs test methodology where:
\itemize{
\item Each change from positive to negative (or vice versa) increments the run count
\item Zero values create breaks between runs
\item The minimum number of runs is 1 (if all values have the same sign and no zeros)
\item The maximum number of runs is \code{n} (if values alternate sign frequently)
}

Note: The function expects ordered data (typically time series) as input since
runs are calculated based on the given sequence order.
