\title{Separate Data into Train, Test, and Validation Sets}
\usage{
separateData(dt, prop = c(2/3, 1/6, 1/6))
}
\arguments{
\item{dt}{A data frame or matrix containing the data to be split.}

\item{prop}{A numeric vector of length 3 specifying the proportions for
train, test, and validation sets respectively. Must sum to 1.
Default is c(2/3, 1/6, 1/6).}
}
\value{
A list with three components:
\item{train}{The training subset of the data}
\item{test}{The testing subset of the data}
\item{eval}{The validation subset of the data}
}
\description{
Randomly splits a dataset into three subsets for machine learning:
training, testing, and validation. This is essential for building
reliable models that don't overfit to your data.
}
\details{
This function helps you prepare data for machine learning by splitting it
into three distinct sets:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Training set}: Used to train your model (learn patterns)
\item \strong{Testing set}: Used to evaluate your model's performance
\item \strong{Validation set}: Used to tune model parameters and prevent overfitting
}

The function ensures that observations are randomly assigned without
replacement, so each observation appears in only one set. The sample sizes
are determined by rounding to the nearest whole number, which means the
actual proportions might differ slightly from what you specify.

\strong{Why use three sets?} In machine learning, using only training and testing
sets can lead to "overfitting" - when your model performs well on test data
but poorly on new, unseen data. The validation set provides an additional
check to ensure your model generalizes well.
}
\examples{
# Example 1: Basic usage with default proportions
data(mtcars)
sets <- separateData(mtcars)

# Check the sizes of each set
cat("Training set size:", nrow(sets$train), "\n")
cat("Testing set size:", nrow(sets$test), "\n")
cat("Validation set size:", nrow(sets$eval), "\n")

# Example 2: Custom proportions (70\% train, 20\% test, 10\% validation)
sets2 <- separateData(mtcars, prop = c(0.7, 0.2, 0.1))

# Example 3: With a smaller dataset
small_data <- data.frame(x = 1:20, y = rnorm(20))
sets3 <- separateData(small_data)

# Example 4: Verify no overlap between sets
sets <- separateData(iris)
train_ids <- rownames(sets$train)
test_ids <- rownames(sets$test)
eval_ids <- rownames(sets$eval)

# Check that there's no overlap (should return 0)
length(intersect(train_ids, test_ids))
