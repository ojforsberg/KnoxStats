\title{Set Reference Level for a Factor}
\usage{
set.base(var, base, data = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{var}{A factor variable whose reference level you want to change.}

\item{base}{A character string specifying the level that should become the
new reference (first) level of the factor.}

\item{data}{A data frame containing the factor variable (optional). If not
provided, \code{var} should be a factor vector.}
}
\value{
A factor with reordered levels where \code{base} is the first level. All other
levels follow in their original order.
}
\description{
Changes the reference (base) level of a factor variable, reordering the levels
so that a specified level comes first. This is useful for statistical modeling
when you want to control which group is used as the reference category in
regression models.

Arrrrrgh! Writing documentation is soooooo boring!
}
\details{
In statistical modeling, factors (categorical variables) need a reference level
against which other levels are compared. By default, R uses alphabetical order
to determine the reference level. This function allows you to specify which
level should be the reference.

For example, if you have a factor "Treatment" with levels "Placebo", "Low",
and "High", R would use "High" as the reference (alphabetically). If you want
"Placebo" as the reference instead, this function will reorder the levels to
"Placebo", "High", "Low".

The function checks that the specified \code{base} level actually exists in the
factor. If it doesn't, an error message will explain the problem.
}
\examples{
# Create a sample factor
treatment <- factor(c("Placebo", "Drug", "Placebo", "Drug", "Placebo"))
levels(treatment)  # Shows: "Drug" "Placebo" (alphabetical order)

# Set "Placebo" as the reference level
treatment_ref <- set.base(treatment, base = "Placebo")
levels(treatment_ref)  # Now: "Placebo" "Drug"

# Using with a data frame
patients <- data.frame(
  id = 1:6,
  treatment = factor(c("A", "B", "C", "A", "B", "C")),
  response = c(10, 15, 12, 11, 14, 13)
)

# Set "B" as reference level
patients$treatment <- set.base(patients$treatment, base = "B", data = patients)
levels(patients$treatment)  # Now: "B" "A" "C"

# Error example - trying to use a non-existent level
try(set.base(treatment, base = "Control"))  # Will produce an error message

# Real statistical application
# In regression, changing reference level affects interpretation:
summary(lm(response ~ treatment, data = patients))
