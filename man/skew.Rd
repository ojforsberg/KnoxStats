\title{Calculate Sample Skewness}
\usage{
skew(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector containing the data values. Missing values
(\code{NA}) will cause an error.}
}
\value{
A single numeric value representing the sample skewness coefficient.
\itemize{
\item Positive values indicate right-skewed (positively skewed) distributions
\item Negative values indicate left-skewed (negatively skewed) distributions
\item Values close to zero indicate approximately symmetric distributions
}
}
\description{
Computes the sample skewness coefficient (also called Fisher-Pearson
standardized third moment) for a numeric vector. Skewness measures the
asymmetry of a probability distribution.
}
\details{
This function calculates the unbiased estimator of population skewness using
the formula:

\deqn{g_1 = \frac{m_3}{m_2^{3/2}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{n(n-1)}}{n-2}}

where \eqn{m_2} and \eqn{m_3} are the second and third sample moments about
the mean, and \eqn{n} is the sample size.

The adjustment factor \eqn{\sqrt{n(n-1)}/(n-2)} provides an unbiased estimate
for normally distributed populations (Joanes and Gill 1998).

\strong{Interpretation guidelines:}
\itemize{
\item Values between -0.5 and 0.5: approximately symmetric
\item Values between -1 and -0.5 or 0.5 and 1: moderately skewed
\item Values < -1 or > 1: highly skewed
}

\strong{Common examples of skewness:}
\itemize{
\item Right-skewed (positive): income distributions, house prices
\item Left-skewed (negative): exam scores (when there's a maximum score)
\item Approximately symmetric: heights, weights
}

\examples{
# Example 1: Symmetric distribution (skewness ≈ 0)
symmetric_data <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
skew(symmetric_data)

# Example 2: Right-skewed distribution (positive skewness)
right_skewed <- c(1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 20)
skew(right_skewed)

# Example 3: Left-skewed distribution (negative skewness)
left_skewed <- c(20, 10, 5, 4, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1)
skew(left_skewed)

# Example 4: Compare with built-in functions from other packages
# Note: Different packages may use slightly different formulas
if (requireNamespace("e1071", quietly = TRUE)) {
  library(e1071)
  skewness(symmetric_data, type = 2)  # G1 calculation
}

# Example 5: Visualize skewness with a histogram
set.seed(123)
normal_data <- rnorm(1000, mean = 50, sd = 10)
hist(normal_data, main = paste("Skewness =", round(skew(normal_data), 3)))

# Example 6: Real-world skewed data
# Simulated household income data (typically right-skewed)
income_data <- c(
  rep(30000, 20), rep(45000, 15), rep(60000, 10),
  rep(80000, 8), rep(100000, 5), rep(150000, 2)
)
skew(income_data)
hist(income_data, main = paste("Income Skewness =", 
                               round(skew(income_data), 3)))
