\title{Fisher's Variance Test}
\usage{
fisher.var.test(x, y = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Either a numeric vector or a numeric nx2 matrix.}

\item{y}{A numeric vector, required if x is a vector.}
}
\value{
A \code{htest} object
}
\description{
Tests for difference in variances between two numeric vectors
}
\details{
This function performs Fisher's variance test by applying the Wilcoxon rank-sum test
to the absolute deviations from the median. The test is robust to non-normal data
and outliers compared to traditional variance tests like the F-test.

The function first computes the absolute deviations of each vector from its median:
\eqn{X' = |x - \text{median}(x)|} and \eqn{Y' = |y - \text{median}(y)|}.
It then performs a Wilcoxon rank-sum test on \eqn{X'} and \eqn{Y'} to determine if
their distributions differ, which indicates a difference in variances between the
original vectors.

The function accepts input in two formats:
\itemize{
\item Two separate numeric vectors: \code{x} and \code{y}
\item A single nx2 matrix where the first column becomes \code{x} and the second column becomes \code{y}
}
}
\examples{
# Using separate vectors
x <- rnorm(30, mean = 0, sd = 1)
y <- rnorm(25, mean = 0, sd = 2)
fisher.var.test(x, y)

# Using a matrix
data <- cbind(x, y)
fisher.var.test(data)
