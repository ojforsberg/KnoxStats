\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector of successes. For one-sample test: a single number.
For two-sample test: a vector of length 2 (c(successes1, successes2)).}

\item{n}{Numeric vector of sample sizes. For one-sample test: a single number.
For two-sample test: a vector of length 2 (c(n1, n2)).}

\item{p}{For one-sample test: hypothesized population proportion (default = 0.5).}

\item{pdiff}{For two-sample test: hypothesized difference in proportions
(default = 0, testing equality of proportions).}

\item{conf.level}{Confidence level for the interval (default = 0.95).}

\item{alternative}{Character string specifying the alternative hypothesis:
\code{"two.sided"} (default), \code{"less"}, or \code{"greater"}.}
}
\value{
A list with class \code{"htest"} containing the following components:
\item{statistic}{The value of the z-statistic.}
\item{p.value}{The p-value for the test.}
\item{conf.int}{A confidence interval for the proportion or difference.}
\item{estimate}{The sample proportion(s).}
\item{null.value}{The hypothesized value of the proportion or difference.}
\item{alternative}{A character string describing the alternative hypothesis.}
\item{method}{A character string indicating the type of test performed.}
\item{data.name}{A character string describing the data.}
}
\description{
Performs one-sample and two-sample Wald tests for proportions, including
confidence intervals. This test is appropriate for large sample sizes
(typically when both successes and failures are at least 5).
}
\details{
The Wald test is a statistical test for proportions based on the normal
approximation to the binomial distribution. It works well with large sample
sizes but can be inaccurate with small samples. The test statistic follows
approximately a standard normal distribution.

\strong{One-sample test:} Tests whether a population proportion equals a
specified value (e.g., is the proportion of left-handed students different
from 0.10?).

\strong{Two-sample test:} Tests whether two population proportions are equal
(e.g., do male and female students have different passing rates?).

\strong{Sample size warning:} The function issues a warning if any category
has fewer than 5 successes or failures, as the normal approximation may not
be accurate. In such cases, consider using exact tests like Fisher's exact test.

\section{Assumptions}{

\enumerate{
\item Observations are independent.
\item Sample size is sufficiently large (np ≥ 5 and n(1-p) ≥ 5 for each group).
\item Data come from a binomial process (each trial has two possible outcomes).

\examples{
# ONE-SAMPLE EXAMPLE:
# Test if the proportion of heads from 100 coin flips is different from 0.5
# Suppose we observed 60 heads in 100 flips
wald.test(x = 60, n = 100, p = 0.5)

# Test if less than 20\% of students are left-handed
# In a sample of 200 students, 30 were left-handed
wald.test(x = 30, n = 200, p = 0.2, alternative = "less")

# Get a 90\% confidence interval for the proportion
wald.test(x = 30, n = 200, conf.level = 0.90)

# TWO-SAMPLE EXAMPLE:
# Test if passing rates differ between two teaching methods
# Method A: 45 passed out of 60
# Method B: 35 passed out of 55
wald.test(x = c(45, 35), n = c(60, 55))

# Test if proportion A is greater than proportion B
wald.test(x = c(45, 35), n = c(60, 55), alternative = "greater")

# Test with a specific hypothesized difference
wald.test(x = c(45, 35), n = c(60, 55), pdiff = 0.1, alternative = "two.sided")
