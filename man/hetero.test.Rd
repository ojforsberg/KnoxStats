\title{Heteroskedasticity Test}
\usage{
hetero.test(e, x, degree = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{e}{A vector of numbers. These are the residuals from the model.}

\item{x}{A vector of numbers. These are the values of the independent variable used in the model.}

\item{degree}{The exponent.}
}
\value{
A \code{htest} class variable
}
\description{
This function tests for the presence of heteroskedasticity in a model.
}
\details{
This function performs a regression-based test for heteroskedasticity by
examining whether the squared residuals (or residuals raised to a specified
power) are correlated with the independent variable. The test is conducted
as follows:
\enumerate{
\item Residuals \code{e} are raised to the power specified by the \code{degree} argument
(default is 2, giving squared residuals: \eqn{e^2}).
\item An auxiliary linear regression is estimated: \eqn{e^degree \sim x}
\item A t-test is performed on the slope coefficient from this regression.
}

The null hypothesis is that the model errors are homoskedastic (constant
variance). A small p-value (typically < 0.05) provides evidence against the
null hypothesis, suggesting the presence of heteroskedasticity.

The test is similar in spirit to the Breusch-Pagan test but uses a direct
regression approach without scaling by the error variance. The function
returns an object of class \code{htest}, consistent with R's standard hypothesis
testing functions, containing the test statistic, degrees of freedom,
p-value, and other diagnostic information.

\examples{
# Generate example data
set.seed(123)
x <- rnorm(100)
y <- 2 + 3*x + rnorm(100, sd = 0.5*abs(x))  # Heteroskedastic errors

# Fit a linear model
model <- lm(y ~ x)

# Test for heteroskedasticity using squared residuals (default)
hetero.test(residuals(model), x)

# Test using residuals raised to the 4th power
hetero.test(residuals(model), x, degree = 4)
