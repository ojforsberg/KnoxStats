\usage{
drop.rownames(df, row.names)
}
\arguments{

\item{row.names}{A vector of names of the rows to be dropped from the data frame.}
}
\value{
A data frame identical to the original, but lacking the stated rows.
}
\description{
This drops rows from a data frame.
}
\details{
This function removes specified rows from a data frame based on their row names.
It uses base R's row name indexing to subset the data frame, keeping only those
rows whose names are not in the \code{row.names} vector.

The function is particularly useful when working with data frames that have
meaningful row names (e.g., sample IDs, observation names) and you need to
exclude specific observations while maintaining the original structure of
the remaining data.

Note that this function operates on row names, not row indices. If your data
frame uses default integer row names (e.g., "1", "2", "3"), you can still use
this function by providing the row names as character strings.
