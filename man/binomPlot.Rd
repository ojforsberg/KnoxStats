\value{

}
\description{
\code{binomPlot} creates a basic plot of observed proportions and a confidence interval for them.
}
\details{
This function produces a plot of observed binomial proportions (x/n) along with their
corresponding confidence intervals. The confidence intervals are calculated using the
normal approximation (Wald) method, with continuity correction applied when
appropriate to improve accuracy, particularly for small sample sizes or proportions
near 0 or 1.

Each proportion is visualized as a horizontal line segment (\code{midlinecol}) within
a rectangular box that represents the confidence interval. The box is filled with
\code{boxcol} and outlined with \code{border}. The x-axis represents the group index (if
multiple groups are provided) or a single point for scalar inputs.

If \code{x} and \code{n} are vectors of length g > 1, the function will plot each group's
proportion and confidence interval side-by-side, spaced along the x-axis.

The confidence interval is computed as:
\deqn{\hat{p} \pm z_{\alpha/2} \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}}{%
      p_hat ± z * sqrt(p_hat * (1 - p_hat) / n)}
where \eqn{\hat{p} = x/n}{p_hat = x/n} and z is the quantile from the standard
normal distribution corresponding to the specified confidence level. Continuity
correction adjusts the interval by \eqn{1/(2n)} when applied.

This visualization is useful for comparing multiple binomial proportions and
assessing the precision of their estimates. The plot does not include axes labels
or titles by default, allowing the user to customize the output as needed.
