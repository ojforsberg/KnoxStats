\usage{
means(x, type = "all", trim = 0, na.rm = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector of values.}

\item{type}{Type of mean to calculate. Options are:
\itemize{
\item{\code{"arithmetic"}: Arithmetic mean (default when non-positive values present)}
\item{\code{"geometric"}: Geometric mean}
\item{\code{"harmonic"}: Harmonic mean}
\item{\code{"all"}: Returns all three means (default)}
}}

\item{trim}{Proportion of observations to trim from each end before
calculating the mean. Must be between 0 and 0.5. Default is 0 (no trimming).}

\item{na.rm}{Logical. Should missing values be removed? Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item{When \code{type = "all"}: A list with components \code{Arithmetic},
\code{Geometric}, \code{Harmonic}, and \code{trim}}
\item{Otherwise: A list with components \code{Mean} (the requested mean)
and \code{trim}}
}
}
\description{
Calculates arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic means with optional trimming
of extreme values. Handles missing values and validates input parameters.
}
\details{
This function calculates three types of means:
\itemize{
\item{\strong{Arithmetic mean}: The sum of values divided by the count,
optionally with trimming. Uses \code{\link[base]{mean}} for calculation.}
\item{\strong{Geometric mean}: The nth root of the product of n values,
calculated as \code{exp(mean(log(x)))}. Only valid for positive values.}
\item{\strong{Harmonic mean}: The reciprocal of the arithmetic mean of
reciprocals, calculated as \code{n / sum(1/x)}. Only valid for positive,
non-zero values.}
}

When the input contains non-positive values (≤ 0), only the arithmetic mean
can be calculated. In such cases, the function will:
\enumerate{
\item{Issue a warning}
\item{Override the \code{type} parameter to \code{"arithmetic"}}
\item{Return only the arithmetic mean}
}

The \code{trim} parameter removes a proportion of observations from each end
of the sorted data before calculation. Trimming is useful for reducing the
influence of outliers. The function validates and adjusts the trim value:
\itemize{
\item{Negative values are set to 0}
\item{Values > 0.5 are set to 0.5}
\item{Integer values between 1 and n/2 are interpreted as counts and
converted to proportions}
}
}
\examples{
# Basic examples
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

# Get all three means
means(x, type = "all")

# Get only arithmetic mean with 20\% trimming
means(x, type = "arithmetic", trim = 0.2)

# Get only geometric mean
means(x, type = "geometric")

# Handle missing values
y <- c(1, 2, NA, 4, 5)
means(y, na.rm = TRUE)

# Non-positive values force arithmetic mean only
z <- c(-1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
means(z, type = "all")  # Warning issued

# Trimmed mean examples
data <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 100)  # 100 is an outlier
means(data, type = "arithmetic")  # Influenced by outlier
means(data, type = "arithmetic", trim = 0.2)  # More robust

# Real-world example: Growth rates
growth_rates <- c(1.05, 1.08, 1.03, 1.06, 1.04)
means(growth_rates, type = "geometric")  # Appropriate for growth rates
