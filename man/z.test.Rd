\title{Z-Test for Means with Known Variances}
\usage{
z.test(
  x,
  y = NULL,
  sigmax,
  sigmay = sigmax,
  mu = 0,
  alternative = c("two.sided", "less", "greater"),
  conf.level = 0.95
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector of data values for the first sample.}

\item{y}{Optional numeric vector for the second sample. If provided, a
two-sample test is performed; otherwise, a one-sample test.}

\item{sigmax}{Known population standard deviation for the first sample (x).}

\item{sigmay}{Known population standard deviation for the second sample (y).
Defaults to \code{sigmax}.}

\item{mu}{The hypothesized value of the mean (for one-sample) or difference
in means (for two-sample). Defaults to 0.}

\item{alternative}{Character string specifying the alternative hypothesis:
\code{"two.sided"} (default), \code{"less"}, or \code{"greater"}.}

\item{conf.level}{Confidence level for the interval. Defaults to 0.95.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{"htest"} containing the following components:
\item{statistic}{The z-test statistic}
\item{p.value}{The p-value for the test}
\item{conf.int}{Confidence interval for the mean or difference in means}
\item{estimate}{Estimated mean(s)}
\item{null.value}{The specified hypothesized value}
\item{alternative}{The alternative hypothesis}
\item{method}{A character string describing the test}
\item{data.name}{A character string describing the data}
}
\description{
Performs a one-sample or two-sample z-test for means when population variances
are known. This is appropriate when you know the true population standard
deviation(s) and want to test whether a sample mean (or difference between
two sample means) equals a specified value.
}
\details{
The z-test is used when population standard deviations are known, which is
rare in practice but useful for theoretical understanding or when dealing
with standardized tests. The test statistic follows a standard normal
distribution under the null hypothesis.

For a one-sample test: z = (x̄ - μ₀) / (σ/√n)

For a two-sample test: z = ((x̄ - ȳ) - μ₀) / √(σ₁²/n₁ + σ₂²/n₂)

The function automatically detects whether to perform a one-sample or
two-sample test based on whether \code{y} is provided.

\examples{
# One-sample z-test
# Known population standard deviation = 15
test_scores <- c(78, 85, 92, 88, 76, 95, 89, 84, 91, 87)
result1 <- z.test(test_scores, sigmax = 15, mu = 85)
print(result1)

# Two-sample z-test with equal variances
group1 <- c(23, 25, 28, 22, 26, 24, 27)
group2 <- c(21, 19, 24, 18, 22, 20, 23)
result2 <- z.test(group1, group2, sigmax = 4, sigmay = 4)
print(result2)

# Two-sample z-test with unequal variances
result3 <- z.test(group1, group2, sigmax = 4, sigmay = 6)
print(result3)

# One-sided test (less than)
result4 <- z.test(test_scores, sigmax = 15, mu = 90, 
                  alternative = "less")
print(result4)

# Different confidence level
result5 <- z.test(test_scores, sigmax = 15, mu = 85, 
                  conf.level = 0.99)
print(result5)
