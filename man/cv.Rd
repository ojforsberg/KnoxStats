\title{Coefficient of Variation}
\usage{
cv(x, na.rm = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A vector of numbers}

\item{na.rm}{What to do with missing values. By default, all missing values are removed.}
}
\value{
Scalar value of the coefficient of variation.
}
\description{
This function calculates the coefficient of variation for univariate data.
}
\details{
The coefficient of variation (CV) is calculated as the ratio of the standard
deviation to the mean. The formula used is:

\deqn{CV = \frac{s}{\bar{x}}}

Where:
\itemize{
\item \eqn{s} is the sample standard deviation
\item \eqn{\bar{x}} is the sample mean
}

This function uses \code{sd(x, na.rm = na.rm)} for the standard deviation
calculation and \code{mean(x, na.rm = na.rm)} for the mean calculation. The
CV is unitless and expresses variability relative to the mean, making it
useful for comparing dispersion across datasets with different units or
vastly different means.

Note that the coefficient of variation is only meaningful for ratio-scale
data (where zero represents an absence of the quantity) and when all values
are positive. The function will return a result for negative values, but
interpretation may not be meaningful in such cases.

\examples{
# Basic usage
cv(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5))

# With missing values
cv(c(1, 2, NA, 4, 5), na.rm = TRUE)

# Compare variability between datasets
cv_data1 <- cv(c(10, 12, 14, 16, 18))
cv_data2 <- cv(c(100, 120, 140, 160, 180))

# cv_data1 and cv_data2 will be equal, showing relative variability is the same
